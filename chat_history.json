You want to build a mobile app called \"BeerMap\" that allows users to mark beer locations on a map, save tasting notes, and view their beer history. Here's a plan to get started with React Native and Expo:\n\n**Features for the First Version (MVP):**\n\n*   **Map View (Main Screen):** Display an interactive map where users can tap to add a \"beer spot.\" Each spot will show the beer name, photo, rating, and a short comment. Pins will be placed on the map using GPS coordinates.\n*   **Add Beer Screen:** A simple form to input beer details: beer name, beer type, optional photo, rating (1-5 stars), and a comment. Submitting the form will create a new pin on the map.\n*   **Profile Screen:** Display a list of the user's saved beers, basic statistics (total beers added, average rating), and options to edit profile picture and username.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5DC` (Beige)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#D4A373` (Light Amber)\n    *   Secondary: `#A97142` (Medium Brown)\n    *   Accent: `#E4C4A7` (Light Tan)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#F0E68C` (Khaki)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** The project is already set up with React Native and Expo.\n2.  **Install Dependencies:** We'll need to install dependencies for mapping, form handling, image uploading, and potentially Supabase if the user enables it for backend functionality.\n3.  **Implement the Map View:** Integrate a map component (e.g., using `react-native-maps`) into the main screen (`app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`). Implement the functionality to add beer spots by tapping on the map.\n4.  **Create the Add Beer Screen:** Build a new screen with the form fields for beer details.\n5.  **Develop the Profile Screen:** Create the profile screen to display the user's beer list and statistics (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`).\n6.  **Implement Bottom Navigation:** Ensure the bottom navigation bar correctly links to the Map, Add Beer, and Profile screens (`app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`).\n7.  **Implement the design elements:** Modify the app to use the specified colors and typography.\n\nNow, let's start by implementing the plan.\n\nFirst, I will ask the coding agent to modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n\nAfter that, I will ask the coding agent to remove the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-30T21:54:15.048320"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the BeerMap app!
